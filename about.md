# About Me
An enthusiast of computer graphics, computer architecture, and low-level things in general. Does not care for languages that forcibly encode numbers as 64-bit floats.
  
The name comes from my GitHub account, which I made when I had serious opinions on which microcontroller families were better than others[^1]. I like to think I've matured since then.

[^1]: Namely PIC over AVR.
